## 🎯 Todo

- [ ] consider moving `web` app into another repository `fs-monorepo` (fullstack monorepo) as i don't really like next.js and it's fullstack not pure client side

## 🏁 Getting Started

For new project, run `/impeccable init` then `/impeccable shape` to update PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md. More [here](https://impeccable.style/designing/).

## 📝 Environment Variables

For first timer, you need to create the 2 environments in your github repo. First is `dev` environment, and second is `prod` environment (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `environment: dev`). In both environments, name it `SPA_ENV_FILE` and `WEB_ENV_FILE` (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `secrets.SPA_ENV_FILE` and `secrets.WEB_ENV_FILE`).

The value for `SPA_ENV_FILE` in `dev` environment is `.env.dev`, and the value for `SPA_ENV_FILE` in `prod` environment is `.env.prod` for `@workspace/spa`. The value for `WEB_ENV_FILE` in `dev` environment is `.env.dev`, and the value for `WEB_ENV_FILE` in `prod` environment is `.env.prod` for `@workspace/web`.

Source of truth is local env files. When changing them, update deployment/CI project env too.

<!-- For first timer, you need to create 2 environments in your github repo.
Go to your Github repo -> `Settings` tabs -> `Environments` -> `New environment` -> `dev` and `prod` (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `environment: dev` and `environment: prod`).

To push our local env variables to the github repo, run:

```bash
# that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `secrets.SPA_ENV_FILE` and `secrets.WEB_ENV_FILE`
gh secret set SPA_ENV_FILE -e dev -f ./apps/spa/.env.dev
gh secret set SPA_ENV_FILE -e prod -f ./apps/spa/.env.prod
gh secret set WEB_ENV_FILE -e dev -f ./apps/web/.env.dev
gh secret set WEB_ENV_FILE -e prod -f ./apps/web/.env.prod
```

Source of truth is local env files. When changing them, update deployment/CI project env too. -->
