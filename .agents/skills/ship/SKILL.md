**Ship** the current branch: commit local work when needed, push, then open or refresh a pull request a reviewer can understand before reading the diff.

## 1. Preflight

Run in parallel:

- `git status -sb`, `git branch --show-current`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD` (fallback `main`)
- `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` — **default-branch gate:** if current branch is `main` or `master` (or equals `origin/HEAD`’s short name), stop. Tell the user to move onto a feature branch first.
- Secrets gate: if any staged or unstaged path looks like a secret (`.env`, `.env.*`, `credentials.json`, `*secret*`, `*credentials*`), stop and list the paths. Do not stage or commit them.
- Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as an optional single string (may be empty).
- `gh --version` — note whether `gh` is ≥ 2.99 (needed for `--attach`).

**Done when:** non-default branch known, secrets clear (or stopped), args parsed, base branch known, `gh` availability known.

## 2. Commit (dirty tree only)

If `git status` is clean → skip to step 3.

Otherwise:

1. Survey staged + unstaged + untracked (exclude secret paths from step 1).
2. Stage the relevant files.
3. Commit message: `$ARGUMENTS` if set; else draft 1–2 sentences focused on **why** (repo commit style: recent `git log`). Pass via HEREDOC:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<message>

EOF
)"
```

**Hook reject:** fix the failure, stage the fix, run **one** successful `git commit` with the same message. Never `--no-verify`.

**Hook rewrites files and the commit succeeded:** if HEAD is this session’s commit and the branch has not been pushed with that commit, `git add` the hook’s rewrites and `git commit --amend --no-edit` once. Otherwise leave a follow-up for the user — do not amend a pushed commit.

**Done when:** working tree clean (aside from ignored paths), or step skipped because it already was.

## 3. Diagram (PR Lens)

Call the Skill tool with `pr-lens` against this branch vs the merge base with `origin/<base>` (or the base from step 1):

1. Author `.pr-lens/graph.json` from the diff.
2. `npx @coldtea/pr-lens-cli@latest validate .pr-lens/graph.json` — fix until clean.
3. `npx @coldtea/pr-lens-cli@latest render .pr-lens/graph.json --theme dark`.
4. Pick attaches: top **architecture** view always; a **data-flow** view only when the change has a sequence worth following. Read names from `.pr-lens/manifest.json`. Do not commit `.pr-lens/`.

**Done when:** valid rendered SVGs exist and the attach set is chosen.

## 4. Push

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Never `--force` or `--force-with-lease`. On rejection, stop and report remote output.

**Done when:** branch is on `origin` at HEAD, or push failed and the user has the error.

## 5. PR body

Resolve the repo’s PR/MR **template** (first hit wins):

1. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` / `.github/pull_request_template.md`
2. `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` / `docs/pull_request_template.md`
3. One `.md` under `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` (prefer `Default.md`, else first alphabetically)
4. `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md`, else the sole `.md` in that folder

Then write `.pr-lens/body.md` on one branch:

| Branch | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| **Template** | **Strict fill:** keep every heading, checkbox block, HTML comment, and section order. Replace only placeholders / blank slots with real content from the diff and session. Check boxes the template asks you to; leave optional stubs and unchecked items that the template leaves open. Only the template’s sections. **Description pseudocode:** read [pseudocode.md](pseudocode.md), then replace `<!-- Pseudocode: before→after -->` with a before→after `diff` (greenfield Before = `N/A — new path`; no behavior = `N/A — no behavior change`). |
| **Blank** (no template) | **Freeform:** invent a short reviewer-first body — why, what changed, how to verify — shaped to the change. No fixed section list. |

**Diagrams (both branches):** Markdown image(s) for each attach: `![<one-line what it shows>](.pr-lens/<file>.svg)`. On **template**, put them under `## Diagram` when that section exists; else the first section that fits screenshots/description/summary; if none fits, append after the filled template. On **blank**, put them under the summary.

Title: `$ARGUMENTS` when the tree was already clean at step 2 and args are set; else draft from commits + diff.

**Done when:** `.pr-lens/body.md` and title are ready; template branch preserved structure (or blank branch is freeform); every attached SVG is referenced as `![alt](path)`.

## 6. Open or refresh PR

Detect an existing PR for this head branch: `gh pr view --json number,url`.

**Labels (catalog) + assignee:** every create and refresh applies both.

1. **Catalog** — load allowed label *names* from the host’s settings file (environment is source of truth; do not invent names):
   - **GitHub:** `.github/settings.yml` → each `labels[].name`
   - **GitLab:** `.gitlab/labels.yml` → each entry’s `name` (or `title`), when present
   - **Other / missing file:** `gh label list --json name -q '.[].name'` (GitHub) or the host CLI’s label list; if that fails too, skip labels and still assign
2. **Pick kind** — from the catalog only, every name that classifies this change (feature work, bug fix, docs, tests, chore, security — including `security-exception` only when the change is an approved exception). Leave triage/workflow names alone (`needs-*`, `ready-for-*`, `wontfix`, `WIP`) — this PR is ready for review. Multiple kind labels when the diff spans them.
3. **Pick risk** — read [risk.md](risk.md). From the catalog, exactly one of `high-risk` / `medium-risk` / `low-risk` (skip risk and say so if those names are absent). Highest match wins.
4. **Assignee** — the user who triggered this skill: `@me`.

**None — create** (only if the branch has commits not in the base; otherwise stop with status, no empty PR):

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file .pr-lens/body.md \
  --assignee @me \
  --label <name>... \
  --attach <svg>...
```

Ready for review (not draft). Base defaults to the repo default unless `gh` requires `--base`. Omit `--label` when the catalog yielded none.

**Exists — refresh:**

```bash
gh pr edit <number> --title "<title>" --body-file .pr-lens/body.md \
  --add-assignee @me \
  --add-label <name>... \
  --attach <svg>...
```

Omit `--add-label` when none were picked. Keep existing labels **except risk:** after create/refresh, add the picked risk name and drop the other two risk names if they are on the PR.

**Auto-merge:** `low-risk` → `gh pr merge <number> --auto --squash` (report if the host rejects). `high-risk` or `medium-risk` → `gh pr merge <number> --disable-auto` when auto-merge is already on.

If `gh` < 2.99: create/edit with body + labels + assignee only; say attaches need `gh` ≥ 2.99 (or publish SVGs and use pr-lens `comment`).

**Done when:** PR URL known; create or edit exited 0; `@me` assigned; kind labels applied; exactly one risk label on the PR (or risk skipped with reason); auto-merge armed only for `low-risk`; attach limitation reported only when URL still valid.

## 7. Hand off

Print: branch, commit short SHA (if step 2 ran), PR URL, kind labels, **risk** (`high-risk` extra / `medium-risk` regular / `low-risk` none + auto-merge), assignee, which diagrams attached.

**Done when:** the user has the PR URL, kind labels, risk (and merge posture), assignee, and attach list.

## Nothing left to ship

Clean tree, `origin` already has HEAD, no commits vs base → short status only (branch, ahead/behind, PR URL if any). Skip create.
