# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. Also check context-scoped ADR directories (below) for decisions local to an app or package.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Multi-context monorepo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── apps/
│   ├── spa/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/
│   └── expo/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
└── packages/
    └── core/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

### Context map (planned)

| Context | `CONTEXT.md` | Context-scoped ADRs |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `spa`   | `apps/spa/CONTEXT.md` | `apps/spa/docs/adr/` |
| `web`   | `apps/web/CONTEXT.md` | `apps/web/docs/adr/` |
| `expo`  | `apps/expo/CONTEXT.md` | `apps/expo/docs/adr/` |
| `core`  | `packages/core/CONTEXT.md` | `packages/core/docs/adr/` |

When work spans multiple contexts, read each relevant `CONTEXT.md` and check both `docs/adr/` and the context-scoped ADR directories.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
